# [OMSP-OPCLOSE-05] Internet
## Description
In the case of connected vehicles, it is possible to open and close the doors, trunk or windows of the cars through the Internet, usually through mobile applications.

Same situation is located with car sharing vehicles, where in addition to the possibility of opening doors remotely with the application, there is a case where an administrator who manages the system could open or close one of any vehicle through a central system, which generally is a web control panel. 

## How to Test
This control will focus on deceiving the vehicle into trigger the opening of the doors through the Internet. This should be done in a way not allowed by the system such as, for example, sending a manipulated data packet to an ECU. This control is closely linked to [OMSP-EXTNET-02: Remote control apps](../External_Network/OMSP-EXTNET-02.md) and [OMSP-SHARE: Car Sharing Systems](../Car_Sharing_Systems/README.md).
